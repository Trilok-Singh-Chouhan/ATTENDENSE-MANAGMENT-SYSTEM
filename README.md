# ATTENDENSE-MANAGMENT-SYSTEM
#  Attendance Management System (C++)

A **console-based Attendance Management System** developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming** and **File Handling** concepts.  
This project allows users to **add students**, **mark attendance by date**, and **view attendance reports** with **Present (%) and Absent (%)**.

---

##  Features

-  Add new students (Roll Number & Name)
-  Mark attendance for each student (Present / Absent)
-  Attendance stored with date
-  Attendance report with percentage calculation
-  Persistent storage using text files
-  Menu-driven console interface
-  No external libraries (uses only standard C++)

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (Class & Methods)
  - File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
  - String manipulation
  - Loops and conditionals
- **Compiler:** g++

##  How the System Works

###  Add Student
- Stores roll number and name in `students.txt`
- Example:

###  Mark Attendance
- User enters date
- Attendance marked individually as **Present (P)** or **Absent (A)**
- Stored in `attendance.txt`
- Example:

###  View Attendance
- Reads student and attendance files
- Calculates:

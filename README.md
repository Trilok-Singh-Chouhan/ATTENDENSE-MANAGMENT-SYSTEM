# ATTENDENSE-MANAGMENT-SYSTEM
# 📘 Attendance Management System (C++)

A **console-based Attendance Management System** developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming** and **File Handling** concepts.  
This project allows users to **add students**, **mark attendance by date**, and **view attendance reports** with **Present (%) and Absent (%)**.

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Add new students (Roll Number & Name)
- 📝 Mark attendance for each student (Present / Absent)
- 📅 Attendance stored with date
- 📊 Attendance report with percentage calculation
- 💾 Persistent storage using text files
- 📋 Menu-driven console interface
- ❌ No external libraries (uses only standard C++)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (Class & Methods)
  - File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
  - String manipulation
  - Loops and conditionals
- **Compiler:** g++

- Attendance marked individually as **Present (P)** or **Absent (A)**
- Stored in `attendance.txt`
- Example:

### 3️⃣ View Attendance
- Reads student and attendance files
- Calculates:
